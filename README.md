### Hi, I’m Sneha Singh 👋

I work on system-level and communication software, primarily in **C** on **Linux**.
My interests lie in understanding protocols end-to-end — from specification
to implementation — with a current focus on **5G NR signaling**.

I work at the intersection of **wireless communication concepts** and
**system-level implementation**, learning best by building, testing,
and debugging real systems on Linux.

**Areas I spend most of my time on:**
- 5G NR RRC messaging (SIB1)
- ASN.1 modeling and UPER encoding/decoding
- TCP-based transport and protocol testing
- Build systems, debugging, and Linux tooling
- Core concepts of modern wireless systems (5G-oriented)

This GitHub is a living workspace for protocol experiments, low-level
implementations, and projects built to deeply understand how things
actually work.
