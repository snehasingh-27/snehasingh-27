### Hi, I’m Sneha Singh👋

I work on system-level and communication software, primarily in **C** on **Linux**.

My interests lie in understanding protocols end-to-end — from specification
to implementation — with a current focus on **5G NR signaling**.

**Areas I spend most of my time on:**
- 5G NR RRC messaging (SIB1)
- ASN.1 modeling and UPER encoding/decoding
- TCP-based transport and testing
- Build systems, debugging, and tooling on Linux

This GitHub is a living workspace: protocol experiments, low-level implementations,
and projects built to deeply understand how things actually work.
